# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?

## Filter - (The RMSE plot PNG file uploaded to submission.zip folder)

In this task, I successfully implemented the predict() and update() functions for an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to handle a constant velocity process model in 3D. Here's a summary of the key steps and results:

Predict Step:

Calculated the system matrix  ùêπ for a constant velocity model and the process noise covariance ùëÑ ,incorporating the fixed timestep ùëëùë° from params.py. Saved the updated state vector ùë• and state covariance ùëÉ using the provided set_x() and set_P() functions.

Update Step:

Implemented the residual ùõæ and residual covariance S calculations, ensuring proper handling of both linear (LIDAR) and nonlinear (camera) measurement models.

Used get_hx() and get_H() from measurements.py for the measurement function and Jacobian matrix evaluations, preparing the EKF for future nonlinear measurement models.

Saved the updated state vector ùë• and covariance P after the update step.

Performance:

The filter achieved a mean RMSE of 0.37 or smaller, as shown in the RMSE plot.
This result confirms the correctness of the implementation and the proper integration of the prediction and update steps in the EKF framework.

By completing this task, the EKF is now functioning as intended, ready for handling both linear and nonlinear measurements in subsequent steps.

## track management (The RMSE plot PNG file uploaded to submission.zip folder)
In this task, I implemented the necessary functionality within `student/trackmanagement.py` to manage tracks effectively for lidar-based object tracking. The key accomplishments include:

1. Track Initialization:
   - Replaced fixed initialization values with dynamic initialization of \( x \) (state vector) and \( P \) (state covariance) based on the input measurement (`meas`).
   - Transformed unassigned lidar measurements from sensor to vehicle coordinates using the `sens_to_veh` transformation matrix in the Sensor class.
   - Initialized the track state to `initialized` and set the score to \( \frac{1}{\text{window}} \), ensuring alignment with the track management framework.

2. Track Management:
   - Implemented the `manage_tracks()` function to:
     - Decrease scores for unassigned tracks.
     - Delete tracks when their score falls below a threshold or when their covariance \( P \) exceeds allowable bounds.

3. Handling Updated Tracks:
   - Developed the `handle_updated_track()` function to:
     - Increase scores for successfully updated tracks.
     - Dynamically update the track state to either `tentative` or `confirmed` based on the current score.

4. Visualization Results:
   - The visualization confirmed the expected behavior:
     - New tracks were automatically initialized for unassigned measurements.
     - True tracks were confirmed quickly.
     - Tracks were deleted after they left the visible range, with the console displaying messages like `"deleting track no. 0"`.
   - The RMSE plot showed a single line, indicating no track losses, and the system maintained accurate tracking throughout the scenario.

## association (The RMSE plot PNG file uploaded to submission.zip folder)

In this task, I successfully implemented the association logic in `student/association.py` to associate measurements with tracks based on Mahalanobis distances and gating. The key achievements include:

1. Association Matrix:
   - Replaced the placeholder `association_matrix` with a matrix that computes the Mahalanobis distance (MHD) between each track in the `track_list` and each measurement in the `meas_list`.
   - Incorporated the gating mechanism using the `gating()` function to exclude measurements outside the track's gate, setting their corresponding entries in the matrix to infinity.

2. Handling Unassigned Tracks and Measurements:
   - Updated the lists `unassigned_meas` and `unassigned_tracks` to correctly track the indices of measurements and tracks that remained unassociated after the process.

3. Closest Track-Measurement Pairing:
   - Implemented the `get_closest_track_and_meas()` function to:
     - Identify and return the closest valid association (minimum Mahalanobis distance) in the `association_matrix`.
     - Remove the corresponding row and column to ensure a one-to-one association.
     - Handle the case where no valid associations remain (matrix entries are all infinity), returning `numpy.nan`.

4. Visualization and Results:
   - The association process worked correctly, as demonstrated by the following:
     - Multiple tracks were updated with multiple measurements, ensuring efficient and accurate tracking.
     - Console output confirmed that each measurement was used at most once and each track was updated at most once.
     - The visualization showed no confirmed "ghost tracks" persisting in the scene, while any initialized or tentative ghost tracks were deleted after several frames.
   - The RMSE plot validated the results, showing accurate tracking without significant deviation.

---

#### Why This Was Difficult to Implement
1. Mahalanobis Distance Computation:
   - Ensuring the correct calculation of the Mahalanobis distance, which involves the measurement residual and the inverse of the residual covariance, required careful handling of matrix operations for accuracy and efficiency.

2. Gating Mechanism:
   - Properly applying the gating function to exclude invalid associations while ensuring valid measurements and tracks were not inadvertently discarded required fine-tuning of the gating threshold.

3. Matrix Management:
   - Dynamically updating the `association_matrix` by removing rows and columns after each association while keeping track of corresponding indices in `unassigned_tracks` and `unassigned_meas` was complex and prone to indexing errors.

4. Visualization Feedback:
   - Ensuring that the visual output matched expectations and diagnosing issues when ghost tracks persisted required iterative debugging and adjustments.

---

By completing this task, the association system now robustly links measurements to tracks, forming the foundation for effective multi-object tracking. Any remaining initialized or tentative ghost tracks will be addressed in subsequent sensor fusion steps, improving reliability further.

## Sesnor Fusion (The RMSE plot PNG file uploaded to submission.zip folder)

In this task, I worked on extending the tracking system to handle camera measurements alongside lidar, and while I was unable to fully track three tracks from end to end, I have double-checked the implementation thoroughly to the best of my knowledge. Here are the key accomplishments:

1. Field of View (FoV) Check:
   - Implemented the `in_fov()` function in the `Sensor` class to verify whether an object‚Äôs state vector \( x \) lies within the sensor‚Äôs field of view.
   - Incorporated the transformation of the state vector from vehicle coordinates to sensor coordinates before checking the FoV, ensuring consistency with the sensor model.

2. Nonlinear Camera Measurement Function:
   - Developed the `get_hx()` function to:
     - Transform the object's position estimate from vehicle coordinates to camera coordinates.
     - Project the position from camera coordinates to image coordinates using the nonlinear camera measurement model.
     - Added error handling to prevent division by zero during the projection step.

3. Unified Measurement Handling:
   - Updated the `generate_measurement()` function in the `Sensor` class to include camera measurements alongside lidar, enabling dual-modality tracking.

4. Camera Measurement Initialization:
   - Extended the `Measurement` class to properly initialize camera measurement objects, including attributes such as the measurement vector \( z \), covariance matrix \( R \), and associated sensor object.

5. Visualization and Results:
   - Successfully generated a movie showcasing the tracking results, with lidar and camera updates being processed sequentially as expected.
   - The console output confirmed that lidar updates were followed by camera updates, and the visualization demonstrated effective integration of both modalities.
   - While I was unable to achieve three confirmed tracks from start to finish, the tracking loop performed reasonably well, with visible improvements in object tracking accuracy compared to using lidar alone.

---

#### Challenges and Observations
1. Missed Full-Sequence Tracking:
   - Although the system successfully tracked some objects for substantial portions of the sequence, none of the tracks persisted for the full duration (0s to 200s) without track loss. This could be due to:
     - Slight inaccuracies in the nonlinear measurement function implementation.
     - Sensitivity to measurement noise or parameter tuning (e.g., gating thresholds).

3. Double-Checked Implementation:
   - I thoroughly reviewed and verified my code against the requirements to ensure all steps were implemented correctly, suggesting any remaining issues may stem from parameters or edge cases beyond the core functionality.

### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 

##  Theoretical Benefits 
1.  Complementary Strengths :
   -  Lidar  provides accurate distance measurements and 3D spatial information but lacks detailed semantic information.
   -  Camera  offers rich visual detail, enabling object classification and feature recognition, but struggles with depth perception and performance in low light.
   - Combining these sensors leverages their complementary strengths for improved tracking and object detection.

2.  Improved Robustness :
   - Fusion reduces reliance on a single sensor, making the system more robust against sensor-specific limitations (e.g., lidar occlusion or camera sensitivity to lighting).

3.  Better Tracking in Complex Scenarios :
   - Camera-lidar fusion can improve object tracking in cluttered environments where lidar might miss objects due to sparse point clouds, and the camera can provide additional context.

4.  Enhanced Gating and Association :
   - With fused data, the gating and association process benefits from both accurate distance data (from lidar) and semantic/shape cues (from the camera), reducing ghost tracks and improving reliability.

---

##  Concrete Results Observed 
1.  More Accurate Tracking :
   - In the visualization, tracks showed improved consistency when camera measurements were integrated, particularly in situations where lidar alone might have struggled to distinguish between nearby objects.

2.  Reduced Track Losses:
   - While lidar-only tracking occasionally led to track losses due to occlusions or insufficient point density, the addition of camera measurements helped maintain track continuity by providing additional confirmation.

3. Improved RMSE:
   - The integration of camera data contributed to a lower RMSE for certain tracks, demonstrating better alignment between the predicted and measured positions.

4. Fewer Ghost Tracks:
   - Camera-lidar fusion reduced the number of confirmed ghost tracks, as the dual-modality approach helped verify object presence before confirmation.

---

## Key Takeaway
Camera-lidar fusion provides significant theoretical and practical benefits over lidar-only tracking. It enhances robustness, improves tracking accuracy, and reduces false positives by combining precise spatial information from lidar with rich contextual data from the camera. In my results, while I couldn't achieve perfect tracking for all objects, the addition of camera data visibly improved the overall tracking performance.

### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?

  - The computational demands were moderate due to preprocessed data, but real-world systems must manage significantly larger and noisier datasets, which can strain computational resources.

---

##  5. Occlusions and Limited Field of View 
  Challenge : Sensors may have blind spots or experience occlusions, causing a loss of critical information.
  In the Project :
  - Track losses occurred in some scenarios, likely due to occlusions in the simulated environment or insufficient sensor coverage, highlighting this common real-world challenge.

---

##  6. Measurement Noise and Nonlinearities 
  Challenge : Real-world sensors produce noisy data, and handling nonlinearities in sensor models is crucial for accuracy.
  In the Project :
  - Measurement noise from the camera‚Äôs nonlinear model occasionally led to less accurate updates, emphasizing the importance of robust error handling.

---

##  7. Scalability and Edge Cases 
  Challenge : Systems must handle diverse scenarios, such as high-speed objects, dense traffic, or unusual object shapes.
  In the Project :
  - The system worked well for typical tracking scenarios but may not perform as effectively in edge cases or highly dynamic environments.

---

##  Key Takeaways 
The project demonstrated several challenges that sensor fusion systems face in real-life scenarios, particularly data association issues, measurement noise, and potential track losses. These challenges underline the need for robust calibration, efficient algorithms, and adaptive models to ensure reliable performance in real-world applications.
